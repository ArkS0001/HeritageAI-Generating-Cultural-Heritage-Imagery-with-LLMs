# Heritage AI: Cultural Heritage Preservation and Restoration Using AI

## Problem Statement

Cultural heritage sites and artifacts hold immense historical, artistic, and social value, representing the collective memory and identity of civilizations. However, these invaluable assets face significant threats from natural disasters, environmental degradation, human conflicts, and the passage of time. Many heritage sites and artifacts have suffered irreparable damage, resulting in the loss of cultural knowledge and historical context. Traditional restoration methods, while effective, can be time-consuming, costly, and limited in scope.

The challenge lies in finding innovative, scalable, and accessible solutions to restore and preserve these cultural treasures. Leveraging advanced AI technologies presents a promising avenue to address this issue by providing tools that can accurately reconstruct and enhance damaged heritage sites and artifacts, thus ensuring their survival for future generations.

Heritage AI aims to tackle this challenge by developing a web application that uses pre-trained AI models to generate restored images and 3D models of heritage sites and artifacts, making the restoration process more efficient, accessible, and informative.

## Overview

Heritage AI is a conceptual web application designed to leverage advanced artificial intelligence technologies for the restoration and preservation of cultural heritage sites. The application aims to provide users with the ability to generate restored images of heritage sites or artifacts and create 3D models from these images.
